> _Why do you use SCAIP?_

Thanks a lot to [Softles](https://github.com/HardlySoftly) community member. He offered some of his useful project links:
1. [Command-based AI](https://github.com/HardlySoftly/DilliDalli) (couldn't understand actually how it works, however)
2. [Game auto-run tool](https://github.com/HardlySoftly/FAF-AI-Autorun)

Project consists of three parts:
1. **player** - is a game modification designed for working with neural network model command prediction results and is, basically, a game AI mod.
   It contains scripts for both local (i.e., debug) installation and global mods vault submission.
2. **teacher** - is a game modification designed for additional data extraction from replays simulation. Inspired greatly (and in fact extends from) this [AI testing auto-run tool](https://github.com/HardlySoftly/FAF-AI-Autorun).  
   It contains scripts for auto-installing for replay simulation as well as multiple simulation runs (for multiple replays) and data extraction.
3. ...
